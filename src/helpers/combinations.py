def combination_moves(possible_rolls: list, distance_1: int, distance_2: int = 0) -> int:
    """
    Takes a list of possible dice roll outcomes, possible_rolls
    and two integers, distance_1 and distance_2, 
    iterates through possible_rolls to count combinations that result in either or both targets
    does not double-count a roll outcome that could satisfy both moves
    returns the number of combinations that result in either or 
    both of those integers through combinations of two dice rolls.

    Args:
        possible_rolls: list of lists of integers, possible outcomes from rolls of two six-sided dice

        distance_2: an integer 1 <= x <= 24 describing the second of the target numbers
    Returns:
        an integer, the number of rolls that permit distance_1 and/or distance_2 moves
