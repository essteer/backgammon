    """
    Takes a list of possible dice roll outcomes, possible_rolls
    calls the itertools powerset function to generate a powerset of combinations from those rolls
    calculates the sum of each non-blank subset, 
    representing the frequency of each possible move choice, 1 <= x <= 24
    returns a dictionary mapping rolls to roll frequencies.

    Returns a dictionary with:
        key: an integer that can be reached from at least 1 roll combination
        value: an integer of the number of combinations that can result in the key integer
